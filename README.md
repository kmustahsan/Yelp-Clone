# Yelp-Clone
My attempt at Yelp

## User Stories

The following **features**are implemented:

* [x] Table rows should be dynamic height according to the content height.
* [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
* [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).
* [x] Filter page. Unfortunately, not all the filters in the real Yelp App, are supported in the Yelp API.
* [x] The filters table should be organized into sections as in the mock.
* [x] Clicking on the "Search" button should dismiss the filters page and trigger the search w/ the new filter settings.
* [x] Distance filter should expand as in the real Yelp app.
* [x] Categories should show a subset of the full list with a "See All" row to expand.
* [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results
* [x] Implement map view of restaurant results
* [x] implement a custom switch
* [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.
* [x] Restaurant Detail page pops open Eat24 / SeatMe if available
* [x] Restaurant Detail page has a map view that automatically zooms into the proper scale between the restaurant and user's current location
* [x] If user location is not available, just zooms to the restaurant pin
* [x] Restaurant Detail page shows a user review
